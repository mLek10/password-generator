# Password-Generator

## Description

 My goal for this project was to modify starter code that creates an application that will generate a random password based on the criteria the user selects. This project gives the user a secure password which is especially helpful for people with access to sensitive information who need that extra layer of security. This project was definitely a challenge but helped me better learn how to create a function and use if statements, it also helped me learn the importance of a for loop and how to execute one.

 ## Usage

 To use the application the user will click the generate password button which will then prompt the user to answer specific questions about the desired length of the password and what types of characters they would like to be included. If the user either doesnt select the proper length and/or any characters they will recieve a prompt stating what requirements need to be met. After clicking through all of the prompts the user will recieve a randomly generated and secure password.
